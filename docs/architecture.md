# Architecture Design

Architecture documentation is not required for this repository.

## Reason

This repository is a **Claude Code Plugin** which does not contain application software requiring architecture documentation.

### Repository Type: Claude Code Plugin

Claude Code plugins contain skill definitions and prompts, not application architecture. This plugin (`co-iso`) provides ISO 27001 compliance tools for procedure review and creation through Claude Code commands and skills.

## Documentation

For more information about this repository type, see:

[Claude Code Extensions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/extensions)

## When This Might Change

Architecture documentation would be required if this repository evolves to include:

- Application source code with business logic
- Software components that interact with each other
- External dependencies that need to be documented (SOUP)
- Critical algorithms or risk controls

If the repository scope changes, remove this file and run the architecture review again.
